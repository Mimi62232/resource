I'm supposed to add three things that I learned this 
week. It can be a tool, a link, or a concept.
First thing I'm going to add is a concept. Even
though we went through a lot of step during the 
tutorial, the daily workflow is only 4 steps. Make
a change, git add file name the change was made in,
commit it, and then push it. I also found out that
no matter what, if files get deleted, GitHub stores
the files in the cloud. The third thing I'm going
to add is Gemini. I redid the tutorial mutiple times
not understanding what I was doing wrong, well the
tutorial kept telling me to enter main, however me
branch name was master.

I feel like I might actually be getting this stuff
down. 

Understanding check...
